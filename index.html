<h1>Technology Advancements</h1>
<h2>Wii</h2>
<p>Nintendo Wii, electronic game console, released by the Nintendo Company of
  Japan in 2006.
  Instead of directly competing with rival video consoles, such as the
  Microsoft Corporation’s Xbox 360 and the Sony Corporation’s PlayStation 3
  (PS3), in terms of processing power and graphics display, Nintendo produced
  an innovative, low-cost console that featured multiplayer “party” games.
  While the Xbox 360 and the PS3 were fighting over the traditional, or
  “hard-core,” gamers, the Wii broadened the entire video-game console market
  and in the process established the largest user base.</p>

    <h2>Ipod</h2>
    <p>
      The iPod is a line of portable media players and multi-purpose pocket
       computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The first version was
        released on October 23, 2001, about ​8 1⁄2 months after the Macintosh
        version of iTunes was released. As of May 28, 2019, only the iPod Touch
         (7th generation) remains in production. Like other digital music
         players, some versions of the iPod can serve as external data storage
         devices. Prior to macOS 10.15 Apple's iTunes software (and other
         alternative software) can be used to transfer music, photos, videos,
         games, contact information, e-mail settings, Web bookmarks, and
         calendars, to the devices supporting these features from computers
         using certain versions of Apple macOS and Microsoft Windows operating
         systems. Before the release of iOS 5, the iPod branding was used for
         the media player included with the iPhone and iPad, a combination of
         the Music and Videos apps on the iPod Touch. As of iOS 5, separate apps
          named "Music" and "Videos" are standardized across all iOS-powered
           products. While the iPhone and iPad have essentially the same
            media player capabilities as the iPod line, they are generally
            treated as separate products. During the middle of 2010, iPhone
            sales overtook those of the iPod.</p>
