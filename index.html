<h1>Technology Advancements</h1>
<h2>Wii</h2>
<p>Nintendo Wii, electronic game console, released by the Nintendo Company of
  Japan in 2006.
  Instead of directly competing with rival video consoles, such as the
  Microsoft Corporation’s Xbox 360 and the Sony Corporation’s PlayStation 3
  (PS3), in terms of processing power and graphics display, Nintendo produced
  an innovative, low-cost console that featured multiplayer “party” games.
  While the Xbox 360 and the PS3 were fighting over the traditional, or
  “hard-core,” gamers, the Wii broadened the entire video-game console market
  and in the process established the largest user base. Released in November
  2012, it was the first eighth-generation video game console and competed with
  Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4. The Wii U was the first
  Nintendo console to support HD graphics.The system was first conceived in
  2008, after Nintendo recognized several limitations and challenges with the
  Wii, such as the general public's perception that the system catered primarily
   to a "casual" audience. With Wii U, Nintendo wished to bring back "core"
   gamers. Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto admitted that the lack of HD and
   limited network infrastructure for Wii also contributed to the system being
   regarded in a separate class to its competitors' systems, the PlayStation 3
   and Xbox 360. It was decided that a new console would have to be
   developed to accommodate significant structural changes. Ideas on which
   direction to take for the new console led to a lot of debate within the
   company, and the project started over from scratch on several occasions.</p>

    <h2>Ipod</h2>
    <p>
      The iPod is a line of portable media players and multi-purpose pocket
       computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The first version was
        released on October 23, 2001, about ​8 1⁄2 months after the Macintosh
        version of iTunes was released. As of May 28, 2019, only the iPod Touch
         (7th generation) remains in production. Like other digital music
         players, some versions of the iPod can serve as external data storage
         devices. Prior to macOS 10.15 Apple's iTunes software (and other
         alternative software) can be used to transfer music, photos, videos,
         games, contact information, e-mail settings, Web bookmarks, and
         calendars, to the devices supporting these features from computers
         using certain versions of Apple macOS and Microsoft Windows operating
         systems. Before the release of iOS 5, the iPod branding was used for
         the media player included with the iPhone and iPad, a combination of
         the Music and Videos apps on the iPod Touch. As of iOS 5, separate apps
          named "Music" and "Videos" are standardized across all iOS-powered
           products. While the iPhone and iPad have essentially the same
            media player capabilities as the iPod line, they are generally
            treated as separate products. During the middle of 2010, iPhone
            sales overtook those of the iPod.</p>

            <h2>Watch</h2>
            <p>
              The first wristwatch was created in 1812, to fit the wrist of the
               Queen of Naples, however, they had previously been introduced in
                the 1570s but were described as an arm watch. Wristwatches were
                primarily worn by women as the watches were prone to damage by
                the elements, which is why men wore pocket watches.The Apple
                Watch was first announced by Tim Cook. Since its birth, the
                Apple Watch has radicallychanged–especially from the way it was
               first marketed.Apple Watch relies on a wireless connection to an
               iPhone to perform many of its default functions such as calling
               and texting. However, Wi-Fi chips in all Apple Watch models allow
                the smartwatch to have limited connectivity features away from
                the phone anywhere a Wi-Fi network is available. Series 3 LTE
                Apple Watches are able to be used without needing to be
                consistently connected to an iPhone, though an iPhone is still
                required to set up the device. First generation and Series 1
                and 2 Apple Watches require an iPhone 5s or later with iOS 11;
                the Series 3 and later LTE models require an iPhone 6 or later
                with iOS 11 or later.The Apple Watch was released on April 24,
                2015 and quickly became the best-selling wearable device with
                4.2 million  Released in November 2012, it was the first
                eighth-generation video game console and competed with
                Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4. The Wii U
                was the first Nintendo console to support HD graphics sold in
                the second quarter of the 2015 fiscal year.</p>

              <h2>Headphones</h2>
              <p>Headphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece,
                and were the only way to listen to electrical audio signals
                before amplifiers were developed. The first truly successful
                set was developed in 1910 by Nathaniel Baldwin, who made them
                by hand in his kitchen and sold them to the United States Navy.
                The name Bluetooth is an Anglicised version of the Scandinavian
                Blåtand/Blåtann (Old Norse blátǫnn), the epithet of the
                tenth-century king Harald Bluetooth who united dissonant Danish
                tribes into a single kingdom. The implication is that Bluetooth
                unites communication protocols.Bluetooth is a standard
                wire-replacement communications protocol primarily designed for
                low power consumption, with a short range based on low-cost
                transceiver microchips in each device.[16] Because the devices
                use a radio (broadcast) communications system, they do not have
                to be in visual line of sight of each other; however, a quasi
                optical wireless path must be viable.[17] Range is
                 power-class-dependent, but effective ranges vary in practice.
                 See the table "Ranges of Bluetooth devices by class".

              <h2> Promethean Board </h2>
              <p> The Promethean ActivBoard comes with two pens: dark gray is
                teacher pen, light gray is student pen. The application is
                called ActivInspire. You have to choose the colors and eraser in
                 ActivInspire. Unlike the SmartBoard there are more than 4
                 colors you can use. To calibrate it there is a circle known as
                 the "Flame of Learning" you have to hold on to.
